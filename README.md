# Movie Quiz

Welcome to my second milestone project, which was developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This is a movie quiz, created with the purpose of entertaining movie lovers while testing their knowledge. It was designed to be responsive on a wide range of devices, while also being easy to navigate though.



## User Experience (UX)

The initial requirements for this project was to create a fun and interactive quiz that could be enjoyed for anyone who loves movies. As previously mentioned the main target are movie lovers,but also anyone who wants to have a bit of fun and learn more about movies. The users will pick one alternative and they will know if it is right or wrong straight away.There are 15 questions, and a single answer. A result’s board will appear at the end of the quiz.


## Features:

- Interactive quiz elements.
- A score counter for correct answers and incorrect ones, which allows users to check their score during the progress of the quiz.
- The user is not allowed to change options once pick one.
- Once clicked on the option, the user will know straight away if it was the correct choice and if not, which is the right option.
- A result's table which contains the number of correct and wrong answers, number of attempts, and the percentage of correct answers.
- If the user desires to quit the quiz, they just need to click on the 'Quit' button and they will be directed to the home page.
- After concluding the quiz, users can play it again or go to the home page.

## Further Testing
* The project was tested on the following browsers: Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. It was designed to be responsive to many different devices: mobile, tablet and desktop.

## Bugs/errors

- I had to create a function to prevent users from changing their answer, once one of the alternatives were already selected. 
- I had a bit of trouble in the beginning with the “Try Again” button, since it was not starting the quiz from the very start. 


## Performance

To measure the performance Web Dev was used, and the results can be seen in the image below:

## Deployment

### Publishing to GitHub Pages

To deploy my website to GitHub Pages, the following steps were taken:

* To deploy my website to GitHub Pages, the following steps were taken:
* A local project was created in GitHub with a new repository called 'Movie quiz'
* The project had regular push and detailed commits which were pushed to the GitHub website before deployment
* The project was deployed by logging in to GitHub and locating the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/biareiam/movie)
* At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu and click
* Scroll down the Settings page until the "GitHub Pages" Section was found
* Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch"
* The page will refresh and you will be brought back to the top of the settings page
* Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://biareiam.github.io/movie/) in the "GitHub Pages" section
* The code can be run locally through clone or download, you can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the code button and then selecting either 'clone' or 'download'
* The Clone option provides a url, which you can use on your desktop IDE
